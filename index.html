							<h2>Saffron</h2>
							<p><b>What is it?</b> Saffron is a spice coming from a plant that grows in very specific places. It is very difficult to harvest, hence its price. <br> 
								<b>What does it taste like? </b>Some people say that saffron tastes slightly bitter to them while still lending a semi-sweet taste to dishes. This highly sought after spice offers several tasting notes: semi-sweet and honey-like, floral, fresh like the sea, musky or mushroomy, or even bitter for some.<br>
								<b>How much does it cost? </b> Saffron varies in quality, starting price can be as low as 10 euros per gram, going up to 47 euros per gram for premium quality (which puts it above gold for its pound for pound price).</p>

							<h2>White truffles</h2>
							<p><b>What is it?</b> White truffles are a type of mushroom which are available only a couple of months a year and are almost exclusively found in one part of Italy. This makes them one of the most expensive ingredients in existence. <br> 
								<b>What does it taste like? </b>The aroma of truffles is musty and sweet, a very intense mushroom smell overlaid with other notes, especially what wine tasters call, forest floor. It cooperates with the flavors in food enhancing and intensifying them. A steak with truffle sauce becomes more meaty, eggs are transformed into a gourmet item, and every aspect of the meal becomes more satisfying.<br>
								<b>How much does it cost? </b> White truffles can go from 13 to 22 euros per gram. It is worthy to note that while they might be technically cheaper than good quality saffron, dishes will call for a lot more truffles than saffron in quantity, which makes white trufffles actually less accessible than saffron.</p>

							<h2>Caviar</h2>
							<p><b>What is it?</b> Caviar is a delicacy consisting of salt-cured roe. The roe can be "fresh" (non-pasteurized) or pasteurized. Pasteurizing caviar decreases its value so we are mostly going to be talking about the fresh variety.<br> 
								<b>What does it taste like? </b>On the tongue, the pop of the eggs releases a rich, buttery consistency that incorporates both the olfactory and taste sensors.  According to scientist, when both the sense of smell and taste are engaged, it stimulates the desire to eat.  Eating caviar should deliver a faintly sweet, nutty or indescribable melt in your mouth combination of flavors.<br>
								<b>How much does it cost? </b> Beluga black caviar (the most expensive type of caviar) ranges from 7 to 10 euros per gram. This does mean that even the most expensive caviar is more accessible than white truffles, which, given caviar's reputation as a luxury, only goes to show the enormous price of white truffles.</p>
